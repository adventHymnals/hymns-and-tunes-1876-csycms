1. With joy we meditate the grace
Of our High Priest above;
His heart is made of tenderness,
His bosom glows with love.


2. Touched with a sympathy within,
He knows our feeble frame;
He knows what sore temptations mean,
For he hath felt the same.


3. He, in the days of feeble flesh,
Poured out his cries and tears;
And in his measure feels afresh
What every member bears.


4. Then let our humble faith address
His mercy and his power;
We shall obtain delivering grace
In the distressing hour.
