1. ’Tis faith that purifies the heart;
’Tis faith that works by love;
That bids all sinful joys depart,
And lifts the thoughts above.


2. Faith shows the promise fully sealed
With our Redeemer’s blood;
It helps our feeble hope to rest
Upon a faithful God.


3. This faith shall every fear control,
By its celestial power,—
With holy triumph fill the soul
In strong temptation’s hour.
