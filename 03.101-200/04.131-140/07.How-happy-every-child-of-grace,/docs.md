^Meter:^ ^CM^
1. How happy every child of grace,
Who knows his sins forgiven!
This earth, he cries, is not my place,
I seek my place in Heaven;


2. A country far from mortal sight,
Yet, oh! by faith I see
The land of rest, the saintâ€™s delight,
The Heaven prepared for me.


3. Oh, what a blessed hope is ours!
While here on earth we stay,
We more than taste the heavenly powers,
And antedate that day.


4. We feel the resurrection near,
Our life in Christ concealed,
And with his glorious presence here
Our earthen vessels filled.


5. On Him with rapture I shall gaze,
Who bought the bliss for me,
And shout and wonder at his grace
Through all eternity.
