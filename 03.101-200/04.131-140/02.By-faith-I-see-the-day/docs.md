1. By faith I see the day
That ends my woes,
When I shall vict’ry gain
O’er all my foes.


2. In yonder realms of light,
By faith I see
A crown of glory bright,
Prepared for me.


3. Oh! may I soon behold
That happy day,
When sorrow, sin, and pain,
Shall flee away!


4. Oh! may I ever keep
The prize in view;
And through the storms of life
My way pursue.


5. Jesus, be thou my guide;
My steps attend;
Oh! keep me near thy side;
Be thou my friend.


6. Be thou my shield and sun,
Be thou my guard;
And, when my work is done,
My great reward.
