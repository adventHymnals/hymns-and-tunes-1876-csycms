1. O Thou that hear’st the prayer of faith,
Wilt thou not save a soul from death,
That casts itself on thee?
I have no refuge of my own,
But My to what my Lord hath done,
And suffered once for me.


2. Slain in the guilty sinner’s stead,
His spotless righteousness I plead,
And his availing blood:
That righteousness my robe shall be,
That merit shall atone for me,
And bring me near to God.


3. Then save me from the second death,
The spirit of adoption breathe,
His consolations send;
By him some word of life impart,
And sweetly whisper to my heart,
Thy Maker is thy friend.


4. Now, Lord, I would be thine alone;
Come, take possession of thine own,
For thou hast set me free;
Released from Satan’s hard command,
See all my powers in waiting stand,
To be employed by thee.
