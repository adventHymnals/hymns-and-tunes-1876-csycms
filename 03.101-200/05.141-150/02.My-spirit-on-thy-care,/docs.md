1. My spirit on thy care,
Blest Saviour, I recline;
Thou wilt not leave me to despair,
For thou art love divine.


2. In thee I place my trust,
On thee I calmly rest;
I know thee good, I know thee just,
And count thy choice the best.


3. Whate’er events betide,
Thy will they all perform;
Safe in thy breast my head I hide,
Nor fear the coming storm.


4. Let good or ill befall,
It must be good for me,—
Secure of having thee in all,
Of having all in thee.
