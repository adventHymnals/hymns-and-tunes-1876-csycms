1. I know that my Redeemer lives,
And ever prays for me;
A token of his love he gives,
A pledge of liberty.


2. Jesus, I hang upon thy word;
I steadfastly believe 
Thou wilt return, and claim me, Lord, 
And to thyself receive.


3. Joyful in hope, my spirit soars
To meet thee from above;
Thy goodness thankfully adores,
And sure I taste thy love.


4. When God is mine, and I am his,
Of Paradise possessed,
I taste unutterable bliss,
And everlasting rest.
