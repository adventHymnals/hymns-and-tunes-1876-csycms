1. Arise, my soul, arise,
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding Sacrifice
In my behalf appears;
Before the throne my Saviour stands;
My name is written on his hands.


2. He ever lives above,
For me to intercede;
His all-redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead;
His blood was shed for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.


3. Five bleeding wounds he bears,
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers,
They strongly speak for me:
Forgive him, oh! forgive, they cry,
Nor let the contrite sinner die!


4. The Father hears him pray,
His dear, anointed One;
He cannot turn away
The presence of his Son;
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I’m a child of God.


5. To God I’m reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for his child;
I can no longer fear;
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And Father, Abba Father, cry.
