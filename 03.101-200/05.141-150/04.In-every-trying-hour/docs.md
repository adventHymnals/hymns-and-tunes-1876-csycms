1. In every trying hour
My soul to Jesus flies;
I trust in his almighty power,
When swelling billows rise.


2. His comforts bear me up;
I trust a faithful God;
The sure foundation of my hope
Is in my Saviour’s blood.


3. Loud hallelujahs sing
To our Redeemer’s name;
In joy or sorrow, life or death,
His love is still the same.
