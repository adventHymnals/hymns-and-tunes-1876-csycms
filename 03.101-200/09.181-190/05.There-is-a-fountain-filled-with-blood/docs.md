1. There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood, 
Lose all their guilty stains.


2. E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.


3. And in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing thy power to save,
When this poor, lisping, stam’ring tongue
Is ransomed from the grave.


4. Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved, to sin no more.
