1. There is a dear and hallowed spot
Oft present to my eye;
By saints it ne’er can be forgot—
That place is Calvary.


2. Oh! what a scene was there displayed,
Of love and agony,
When our Redeemer bowed his head,
And died on Calvary.


3. When fainting under guilt’s dread load,
Unto the cross I ’ll fly,
And trust the merits of that blood
That flowed at Calvary.


4. Whene’er I feel temptation’s power,
On Jesus I ’ll rely,
And in the sharp, conflicting hour
Repair to Calvary.
