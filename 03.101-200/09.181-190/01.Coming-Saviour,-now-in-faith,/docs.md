1. Coming Saviour, now in faith,
We remember still thy death;
Thou wast broken—thou hast died;
For us thou wast crucified.


2. While in faith we drink the wine,
Of thy blood we see the sign;
Wash us pure from every stain,
Thou that comest soon to reign.


3. Lord, we thus remember thee,
But we long thy face to see—
Long to reach our heavenly home;
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!


4. Quickly, thou thyself wilt come;
Thou wilt raise us to thy throne,
And thy glories here display
Through a never-ending day.
