1. Jesus invites his saints
To meet around his board,
And sup in mem’ry of the death
And sufferings of their Lord.


2. We take the bread and wine,
As emblems of thy deatli;
Lord, raise our souls above the sign,
To feast on thee by faith.


3. Faith eats the bread of life,
And drinks the living wine;
It looks beyond this scene of strife—
Unites us to the Vine.


4. Soon shall the night be gone,
Our Lord will come again;
The marriage supper of the Lamb
Will usher in his reign.
