1. Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From thy wounded side that flowed,
Be of sin the perfect cure:
Save me, Lord, and make me pure.


2. Should my tears forever flow,
Should my zeal no languor know,
This, for sin, could not atone:
Thou must save, and thou alone.
In my hand no price I bring;
Simply to thy cross I cling.


3. When my pilgrimage I close,
Victor oâ€™er the last of foes,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See thee on thy Judgment throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee.
