1. O thou, my soul, forget no more
The Friend who all thy sorrows bore;
Let every idol be forgot;
But, O my soul, forget Him not.


2. Eternal truth and mercy shine
In him, and he himself is thine;
And canst thou, then, with sin beset,
Such charms, such matchless charms, forget?


3. Oh, no! till life itself depart,
His name shall cheer and warm my heart-
And, lisping this, from earth Iâ€™ll rise,
And join the chorus of the skies.
