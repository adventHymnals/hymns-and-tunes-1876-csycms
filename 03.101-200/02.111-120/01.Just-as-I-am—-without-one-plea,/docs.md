1. Just as I am— without one plea,
But that thy blood was shed for me,
And that thou bidst me come to thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


2. Just as I am— and waiting not 
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


3. Just as I am—though tossed about 
With many a conflict, many a doubt—
“Fightings within, and fears without,”
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


4. Just as I am—poor, wretched, blind— 
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in thee to find;
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


5. Just as I am— thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; 
Because thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.


6. Just as I am—thy love, I own,
Has broken every barrier down;
Now to be thine, and thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
