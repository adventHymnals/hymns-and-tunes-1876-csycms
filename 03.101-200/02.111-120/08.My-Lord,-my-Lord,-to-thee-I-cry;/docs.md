1. My Lord, my Lord, to thee I cry;
Thy mercy would I know;
Thy purifying blood apply,
And wash me white as snow.


2. Touch me, and make the leper clean;
Purge my iniquity;
Unless thou wash my soul from sin,
I have no part in thee.


3. But art thou not already mine?
Answer, if mine thou art;
Whisper within, thou Love divine,
And cheer my drooping heart.
