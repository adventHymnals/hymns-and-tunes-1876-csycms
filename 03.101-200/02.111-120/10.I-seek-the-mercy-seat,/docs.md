1. I seek the mercy-seat,
Where thou dost answer prayer;
There humbly fall before thy feet,
For none can perish there.


2. Thy promise is my plea;
With this I venture nigh;
Thou callest burdened souls to thee,
And such, O Lord, am I.


3. Bowed down beneath my sin,
By Satan sorely pressed;
By wars without and fears within,
I come to thee for rest.


4. Be thou my hiding-place;
That, sheltered near thy side,
I may rejoice in Jesus’ grace—
In Jesus crucified.


5. Oh, wondrous love! to die,
To bear the cross and shame,
That guilty sinners, such as I,
Might plead thy gracious name.
