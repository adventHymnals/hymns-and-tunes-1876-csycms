1. Come, humble sinner, in whose breast
A thousand thoughts revolve,
Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed,
And make this last resolve:


2. I’ll go to Jesus, though my sins
Like mountains round me close;
I know his courts, I’ll enter in,
Whatever may oppose.


3. Prostrate I’ll lie before his throne,
And there my guilt confess;
I’ll tell him, I’m a wretch undone
Without his sov’reign grace.


4. Perhaps he will admit my plea,
Perhaps will hear my prayer;
==But if I perish I will pray,
And perish only there.==
