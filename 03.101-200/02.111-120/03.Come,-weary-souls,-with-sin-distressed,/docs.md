1. Come, weary souls, with sin distressed,
The Saviour offers heavenly rest;
The kind, the gracious call obey,
And cast your gloomy fears away.


2. Oppressed with guilt, a painful load,
Oh, come and spread your woes abroad!
Divine compassion, mighty love,
Will all the painful load remove.


3. Here mercyâ€™s boundless ocean flows,
To cleanse your guilt, and heal your woes;
Pardon, and life, and endless peace,
How rich the gift! how free the grace!


4. Lord, we accept, with thankful hearts,
The hopes thy gracious word imparts;
We come with trembling, yet rejoice,
And bless the kind, inviting voice.


5. Dear Saviour, let thy powerful love
Confirm our faith, our fears remove;
And sweetly influence every breast,
And guide us to eternal rest.
