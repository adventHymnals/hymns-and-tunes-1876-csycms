1. Return, O wanderer, return,
And seek thy Father’s face;
Those new desires which in thee burn,
Were kindled by his grace.


2. Return, O wanderer, return,
He hears thy humble sigh;
He sees thy softened spirit mourn,
When no one else is nigh.


3. Return, O wanderer, return;
Thy Saviour bids thee live;
Come to his cross, and, grateful, learn
How freely he’ll forgive.


4. Return, O wanderer, return,
And wipe the falling tear;
Thy Father calls— no longer mourn;
’Tis love invites thee near.


5. Return, O wanderer, return;
Regain thy long-sought rest;
The Saviour’s melting mercies yearn
To clasp thee to his breast.
