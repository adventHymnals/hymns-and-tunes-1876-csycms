1. ’Tis the last call of mercy, that lingers for thee;
O sinner, receive it; to Jesus now flee!
He often has called thee; but thou hast refused!
His offered salvation and love are abused!


2. If thou slightest this warning now offered at last,
Thine will be the sad mourning—the harvest is passed;
Salvation I’ve slighted, the summer is o’er,
And now there is pardon, sweet pardon, no more.


3. ’Tis the last call of mercy; Oh! turn not away,
For now swiftly hasteth the dread vengeance day!
The Spirit invites you, and pleads with you, come;
Oh! come to life’s waters, nor thirstingly roam.


4. ’Tis the last call of mercy; Oh! steel not thy heart,
For now she is rising, from earth to depart!
The Bride is now calling—ye thirsty souls, come!
Oh! come with the ransomed; in Heaven there’s room!


5. ’Tis the last call of mercy, that lingers for thee;
Break away from thy bondage, O sinner, be free!
Be not a sad mourner—the harvest is passed,
The summer is ended—and perish at last.
