1. Broad is the road that leads to death,
And thousands walk together there;
But wisdom shows a narrow path,
With here and there a traveler.


2. Deny thyself, and take thy cross,
Is thy Redeemer’s great command;
Nature must count her gold but dross,
If she would gain that heavenly land.


3. The fearful soul that tires and faints,
And walks the ways of God no more,
Is but esteemed almost a saint.
And makes his own destruction sure.


4. Lord, let not all my hopes be vain;
Create my heart entirely new;
Let thy sweet Spirit me sustain—
Oh! guide me all life’s journey through.
