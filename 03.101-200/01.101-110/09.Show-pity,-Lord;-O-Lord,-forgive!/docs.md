1. Show pity, Lord; O Lord, forgive!
Let a repenting sinner live;
Are not thy mercies large and free?
May not the guilty trust in thee?


2. My crimes, though great, do not surpass
The power and glory of thy grace;
Oh, wash my soul from every sin,
And make my guilty conscience clean!


3. My lips with shame my sins confess,
Against thy law, against thy grace;
Lord, should thy judgment be severe,
I am condemned, but thou art clear.


4. Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,
Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,
Would light on some sweet promise there,
Some sure support against despair.
