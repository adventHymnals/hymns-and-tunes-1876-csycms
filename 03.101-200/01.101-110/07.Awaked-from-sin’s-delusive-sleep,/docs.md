1. Awaked from sin’s delusive sleep,
My heavy guilt I feel, and weep;
Beneath a weight of woes oppressed,
I come to thee, my Lord, for rest.


2. Now, from thy throne of grace above,
Look down upon my soul in love;
That smile shall sweeten all my pain,
And make my soul rejoice again.


3. By thy divine, transforming power,
My ruined nature now restore;
And let my life and temper shine,
In blest resemblance, Lord, to thine.
