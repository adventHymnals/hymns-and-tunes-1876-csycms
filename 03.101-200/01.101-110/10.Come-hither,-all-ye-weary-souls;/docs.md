1. Come hither, all ye weary souls;
Ye heavy-laden sinners, come;
I’ll give you rest from all your toils,
And raise you to my heavenly home.


2. They shall find rest who learn of me;
I’m of a meek and lowly mind;
But passion rages like the sea,
And pride is restless as the wind.


3. Blest is the man whose shoulders take
My yoke, and bear it with delight!
My yoke is easy to his neck,
My grace shall make the burden light.


4. Jesus, we come at thy command;
With faith, and hope, and humble zeal,
Resign our spirits to thy hand,
To mould and guide us at thy will.
