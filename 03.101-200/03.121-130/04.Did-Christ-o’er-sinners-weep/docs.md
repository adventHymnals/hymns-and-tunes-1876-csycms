1. Did Christ o’er sinners weep?
And shall our cheeks be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
Burst forth from every eye.


2. The Son of God in tears,
The wond’ring angels see!
Be thou astonished, O my soul!
He shed those tears for thee.


3. He wept that we might weep;
Each sin demands a tear;
In Heaven alone no sin is found,
And there’s no weeping there.
