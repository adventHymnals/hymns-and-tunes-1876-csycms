1. Sinners, haste to mercy’s gate,
Strive, oh! strive to enter there;
Hasten, lest ye come too late,
Lest in vain shall be your prayer.


2. Soon the Saviour will arise,
And forever shut the door:
Hopeless then will be your cries;
God will welcome you no more.


3. From his glorious seat within,
Zion’s King so long forgot,
Then will say, Ye slaves of sin,
Hence depart, I know you not.


4. Oh! the anguish of that word;
Anguish which no measure knows;
Sinners, haste to seek the Lord,
Ere the door of mercy close.
