1. Ah! whither should I go,
Burdened, and sick, and faint?
To whom should I my trouble show,
And pour out my complaint?


2. My Saviour bids me come;
Ah! why do I delay?
He calls the weary sinner home,
And yet from him I stay.


3. What is it keeps me back,
From which I cannot part,â€”
Which will not let the Saviour take
Possession of my heart?


4. I now believe, in thee
Compassion reigns alone; 
According to my faith, to me 
Oh, let it, Lord, be done!
