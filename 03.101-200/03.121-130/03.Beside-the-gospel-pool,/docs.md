^Meter:^ ^SM^
1. Beside the gospel pool,
Appointed for the poor,
From day to day my helpless soul
Hath waited for a cure.


2. How often have I thought,
Why should I longer lie?
Surely the mercy I have sought,
Is not for such as I.


3. But whither can I go?
There is no other pool,
Where streams of sovereign mercy flow,
To make a sinner whole.


4. Still, then, from day to day,
Iâ€™ll wait, and hope, and try;
Can Jesus hear a sinner pray,
Yet suffer him to die?


5. No; he is full of grace,
And never will permit,
A soul that fain would see his face
To perish at his feet.
