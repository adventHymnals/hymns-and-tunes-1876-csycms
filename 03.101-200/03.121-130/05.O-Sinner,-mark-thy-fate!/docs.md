1. O Sinner, mark thy fate!
Soon will the Judge appear;
And then thy cries will come too late; 
Too late for God to hear.


2. The day of mercy gone,
The Spirit grieved away,
The cup, long filling, now o’erflown, 
Demands the vengeful day.


3. Thy God, insulted, seems
To draw his glittering sword;
And o’er thy guilty head it gleams, 
To vindicate his word.


4. One only hope I see—
O sinner, seize it now:
The blood that Jesus shed for thee
No other hope hast thou.
