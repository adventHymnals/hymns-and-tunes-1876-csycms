1. Sinner, art thou still secure?
Wilt thou still refuse to pray?
Can thy heart or hands endure 
In the Lord’s avenging day?


2. At his presence nature shakes;
Earth affrighted hastes to flee;
Solid mountains melt like wax;
What will then become of thee?


3. Who his advent may abide?
You that glory in your shame,
Will you find a place to hide,
When the world is wrapt in flame?
