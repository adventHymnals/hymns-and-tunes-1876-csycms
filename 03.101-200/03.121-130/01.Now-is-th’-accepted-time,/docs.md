1. Now is th’ accepted time,
Now is the day of grace;
Now, sinners, come without delay, 
And seek the Saviour’s face.


2. Now is th’ accepted time,
The Saviour calls to-day; 
To-morrow it may be too late
Then why should you delay?


3. Now is th’ accepted time,
The gospel bids you come;
And every promise in his word 
Declares there yet is room.
