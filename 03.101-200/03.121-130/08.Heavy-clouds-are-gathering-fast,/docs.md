1. Heavy clouds are gathering fast,
Tokens of destruction sure:
Sinner, now before the blast,
Seek a shelter to secure.


2. Hear you not the distant sound,
Of the thunder murmuring low?
Haste thee ere the trembling ground
Hide thee in the gulf below.


3. Thousand voices from afar,
Warn thee of thy coming fate:
Careless sinner, now beware!
Haste thee, e’er it be too late!


4. Crimes in every shape increase;
Judgments stalk throughout the land;
Signs are borne on every breeze,
That destruction is at hand.


5. Darker clouds will soon arise,
Louder still the thunders roar,
Fiercer lightnings pierce the skies—
But the sinner’s day is o’er.
