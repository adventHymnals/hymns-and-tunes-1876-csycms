1. Father, I dare believe
Thee merciful and true!
Thou wilt my guilty soul forgive,
My fallen soul renew.


2. Come, then, for Jesus’ sake,
And bid my heart be clean;
An end of all my troubles make,
An end of all my sin.


3. While at thy cross I lie,
Jesus, the grace bestow;
Now thy all-cleansing blood apply,
And I am white as snow.


4. I cannot wash my heart,
But by believing thee,
And waiting for thy blood t’impart
The spotless purity.
