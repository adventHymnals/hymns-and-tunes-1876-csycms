1. Down to the sacred wave,
The Lord of life was led;
And he who came our souls to save,
In Jordan bowed his head.


2. He taught the solemn way;
He fixed the holy rite;
He bade his ransomed ones obey,
And keep the path of light.


3. Blest Saviour, we will tread
In thine appointed way;
Let glory oâ€™er these scenes be shed,
And smile on us to-day.
