1. Salem’s bright King, Jesus by name,
In ancient time to Jordan came,
All righteousness to fill;
’Twas there the ancient Baptist stood,
Whose name was John, a man of God,
To do his Master’s will.


2. Down in old Jordan’s rolling stream
The Baptist led the holy Lamb,
And there did him baptize;
Jehovah saw his holy Son,
And was well pleased in what he’d done,
And owned him from the skies.


3. This is my Son, Jehovah cries;
On him, to rest, the Spirit flies;
O children, hear ye him!
Hark! ’tis his voice, behold he cries—
Repent, believe, and be baptized,
And Christ will save from sin.


4. Come, children, come, his voice obey;
Salem’s bright King has marked the way,
And has a crown prepared;
Oh! then arise and give consent;
Walk in the way that Jesus went,
And have the great reward.
