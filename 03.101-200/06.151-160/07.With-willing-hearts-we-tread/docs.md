1. With willing hearts we tread
The path the Saviour trod;
We love th’ example of our Head,
The glorious Lamb of God.


2. On thee, on thee alone,
Our hope and faith rely,
O thou, who wilt for sin atone,
Who didst for sinners die!


3. We trust thy sacrifice;
To thy dear cross we flee;
Oh! may we die to sin, and rise
To life and bliss in thee.
