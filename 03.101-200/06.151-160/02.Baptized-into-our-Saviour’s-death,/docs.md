1. Baptized into our Saviour’s death,
Our souls to sin must die;
With Christ our Lord we live anew,
With Christ ascend on high.


2. There by his Father’s side he sits,
Enthroned divinely fair;
Yet owns himself our Brother still,
And our forerunner there.


3. Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
On wings of faith and love;
Above our choicest treasure lies,—
And be our hearts above.


4. Let not earth’s pleasures draw us down;
Oh! give us strength to rise,
And through thy strong, attractive power,
At last to gain the prize.
