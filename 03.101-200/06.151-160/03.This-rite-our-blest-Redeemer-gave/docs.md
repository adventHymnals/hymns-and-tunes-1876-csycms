1. This rite our blest Redeemer gave
To all in him believing;
He bids us seek this hallowed grave,
To his example cleaving.
I’ll follow then my glorious Lord,
Whate’er the ties I sever;
He saves my soul, he’s left his word
To guide me now and ever.


2. For me the cross and shame to bear,
Dear Saviour, thou wast willing;
Nor would I shrink thy yoke to wear,
All righteousness fulfilling.
I’ll follow, &c.


3. Jesus, to thee I yield my all;
In thy kind arms infold me:
My heart is fixed— no fears appall—
Thy gracious power shall hold me.
I’ll follow, &c.
