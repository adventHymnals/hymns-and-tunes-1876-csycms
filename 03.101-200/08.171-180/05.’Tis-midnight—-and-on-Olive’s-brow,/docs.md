1. ’Tis midnight— and on Olive’s brow,
The star is dimmed that lately shone;
’Tis midnight— in the garden now
The suffering Saviour prays alone.


2. ’Tis midnight— and, from all removed,
The Saviour wrestles lone with fears;
E’en that disciple whom he loved
Heeds not his Master’s grief and tears.


3. ’Tis midnight— and, for others’ guilt,
The man of sorrows weeps in blood;
Yet he, who hath in anguish knelt,
Is not forsaken by his God.


4. ’Tis midnight— and, from ether plains,
Is borne the song that angels know;
Unheard by mortals are the strains
That sweetly soothe the Saviour’s woe.
