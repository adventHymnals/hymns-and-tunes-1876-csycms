1. Let Thy Spirit, blessed Saviour,
Come and bid our doubtings cease,
Come, oh! come with love and favor,
Fill us all with joy and peace.


2. Fearful dangers are around us,
Satan watches to destroy;
Lord, our foes would fain confound us;
Oh, for us thy might employ!


3. On thy word our souls are resting;
Taught by thee, thy name we love;
Sweetest of all names is Jesus;
How it doth our spirits move!


4. Let us not, O Lord, be weary
Of the roughness of the way;
Though the road be often dreary,
Thou shalt drive our gloom away.
