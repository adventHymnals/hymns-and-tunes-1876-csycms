^Meter:^ ^CM^
1. Spirit Divine, attend our prayer,
And make our hearts thy home;
Descend with all thy gracious power:
Come, Holy Spirit, come!


2. Come as the light: to us reveal
Our sinfulness and woe;
And lead us in those paths of life
Where all the righteous go.


3. Come as the fire, and purge our hearts,
Like sacrificial flame;
Let our whole soul an offering be
To our Redeemerâ€™s name.


4. Come as the wind, with rushing sound,
With Pentecostal grace;
And make the great salvation known,
Wide as the human race.


5. Spirit Divine, attend our prayer,
And make our hearts thy home;
Descend with all thy gracious power
Come, Holy Spirit, come!
