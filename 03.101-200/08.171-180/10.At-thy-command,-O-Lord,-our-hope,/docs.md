1. At thy command, O Lord, our hope,
We come around thy table here;
We break the bread, we bless the cup,
That show thy death till thou appear.


2. Our faith adores thy bleeding love,
And trusts for life in One that died;
We hope for heavenly crowns above,
From a Redeemer crucified.


3. Let the vain world pronounce it shame,
And cast their scandals on thy cause!
We come to boast our Saviour’s name,
And make our triumph in his cross.


4. With joy we tell the scoffing age,—
He that was dead hath left the tomb;
He lives above their utmost rage,
And we are waiting till he come.
