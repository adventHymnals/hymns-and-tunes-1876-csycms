^Meter:^ ^8s^&^7s^
1. Love divine, all love excelling,
Joy of Heaven, to earth come down!
Fix in us thy humble dwelling;
All thy faithful mercies crown,


2. Jesus! thou art all compassion,â€”
Pure, unbounded love thou art;
Visit us with thy salvation,
Enter every trembling heart.


3. Breathe, oh! breathe thy loving Spirit
Into every troubled breast!
Let us all in thee inherit;
Let us find thy promised rest.


4. Changed from glory into glory,
Till in Heaven we take our place;
Till we cast our crowns before thee,
Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
