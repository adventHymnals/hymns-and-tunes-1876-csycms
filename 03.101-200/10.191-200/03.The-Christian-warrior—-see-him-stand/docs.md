1. The Christian warrior— see him stand.
In the whole armor of his God;
The Spirit’s sword is in his hand;
His feet are with the gospel shod;


2. In panoply of truth complete,
Salvation’s helmet on his head,
With righteousness, a breastplate meet,
And faith’s broad shield before him spread.


3. With this, Omnipotence he moves,
From this the alien armies flee;
Till more than conqueror he proves,
Through Christ, who gives him victory.


4. Thus strong in his Redeemer’s strength,
Sin, death, and hell, he tramples down,
Fights the good fight, and wins at length,
Through mercy, an immortal crown.
