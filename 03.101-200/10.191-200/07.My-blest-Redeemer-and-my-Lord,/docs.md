1. My blest Redeemer and my Lord,
I read my duty in thy word;
But in thy life the law appears,
Drawn out in living characters.


2. What truth and love thy bosom fill!
What zeal to do thy Fatherâ€™s will!
Such zeal, and truth, and love divine,
I would transcribe, and make them mine.


3. Cold mountains and the midnight air
Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;
The desert thy temptations knew,
Thy conflict, and thy victory too.


4. Be thou my pattern; make me bear
More of thy gracious image here;
Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
Among the followers of the Lamb.
