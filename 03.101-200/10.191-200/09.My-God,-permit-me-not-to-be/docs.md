1. My God, permit me not to be
A stranger to myself and thee;
Amidst a thousand thoughts I rove,
Forgetful of my highest love.


2. Why should my passions mix with earth,
And thus debase my heavenly birth?
Why should I cleave to things below,
And let my God, my Saviour, go?


3. Call me away from flesh and senseâ€”
One sovereign word can draw me thence;
I would obey the voice divine,
And all inferior joys resign.


4. Be earth, with all her scenes, withdrawn;
Let noise and vanity be gone;
In secret silence of the mind,
My Heaven, and there my God, I find.
