1. Let me but hear my Saviour say,
Strength shall be equal to thy day,—
Then I rejoice in deep distress,
Upheld by all-sufficient grace.


2. I can do all things, or can bear
All suffering, if my Lord be there;
Sweet pleasures mingle with the pains,
While he my sinking head sustains.


3. I glory in infirmity,
That Christ’s own power may rest on me;
When I am weak, then am I strong:
Grace is my shield, and Christ my song.
