1. Afflicted saint, to Christ draw near,
Thy Saviour’s gracious promise hear;
His faithful word declares to thee,
That as thy day thy strength shall be.


2. Let not thy heart despond, and say,
How shall I stand the trying day?
He has engaged by firm decree,
That as thy day thy strength shall be.


3. Thy faith is weak, thy foes are strong,
And if the conflict should be long,
Thy Lord will make the tempter flee,
For as thy day thy strength shall be.


4. Should persecution rage and flame,
Still trust in thy Redeemer’s name;
In fiery trials thou shalt see
That as thy day thy strength shall be.
