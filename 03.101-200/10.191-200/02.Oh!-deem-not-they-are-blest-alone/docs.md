1. Oh! deem not they are blest alone
Whose lives a 'peaceful tenor keep;
For God, who pities man, hath shown
A blessing for the eyes that weep.


2. The light of smiles shall fill again
The lids that overflow with tears;
And weary hours of woe and pain
Are promises of happier years.


3. There is a day of sunny rest
For every dark and troubled night;
And grief may bide an evening guest,
But joy shall come with early light.


4. Nor let the good man’s trust depart,
Though life its common gifts deny;
Though with a sad and broken heart,
He sees his hopes most cherished die.


5. For God has marked each sorrowing day,
And numbered every secret tear;
And Heaven’s long age of bliss shall pay
For all his children suffer here.
