1. Triumphant Zion, lift thy head
From dust, from darkness, and the dead!
Though humbled long, awake at length,
And gird thee with thy Saviour’s strength.


2. Put all thy beauteous garments on,
And let thy excellence be known;
Decked in the robes of righteousness,
Thy glories shall the world confess.


3. No more shall foes unclean invade,
And fill thy hallowed walls with dread;
No more shall hell’s insulting host
Their victory and thy sorrows boast.


4. God, from on high, has heard thy prayer;
His hand thy ruin shall repair;
Nor will thy watchful Monarch cease
To guard thee in eternal peace.
