1. Jesus, thine all-victorious love
Shed in my heart abroad:
Then shall my feet no longer rove,
Nor leave the heavenly road.


2. Oh! that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow;
Burn up the dross of base desire,
And make the mountains flow.


3. Oh! that it now from heaven might fall,
And all my sins consume:
Come, Holy Ghost, for thee I call;
Spirit of burning, come.


4. Refining fire, go through my heart;
Illuminate my soul;
Scatter thy life through every part,
And sanctify the whole.
