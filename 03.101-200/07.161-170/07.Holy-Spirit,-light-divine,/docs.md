1. Holy Spirit, light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine;
Chase the shades of night away,
Turn the darkness into day.


2. Holy Spirit, power divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long has sin, without control,
Held dominion oâ€™er my soul.


3. Holy Spirit, joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
Bid my many woes depart;
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.


4. Holy Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine;
Cast down every idol throne;
Reign supreme, and reign alone.
