1. Holy Spirit! fount of blessing,
Ever watchful, ever kind;
Thy celestial aid possessing,
Prisoned souls deliv’rance find;
Seal of truth and bond of union,
Source of light, and flame of love,
Symbol of divine communion,
In the olive-bearing dove.


2. Heavenly guide from paths of error,
Comforter of minds distressed;
When the billows fill with terror,
Pointing to an ark of rest;—
Promised pledge! eternal Spirit!
Greater than all gifts below,—
May our hearts thy grace inherit;
May our lips thy glories show.
