1. Let plenteous grace descend on those
Who, hoping in thy word,
This day have solemnly declared
That Jesus is their Lord.


2. With cheerful feet may they advance,
And run the Christian race,
And, through the troubles of the way,
Find all-sufficient grace.


3. Lord, plant us all into thy death,
That we thy life may proveâ€”
Partakers of thy cross beneath,
And of thy crown above.


4. Come Holy Spirit, Love divine,
Thy grace to us be given;
To a new life our souls incline,
A life for God and Heaven.
