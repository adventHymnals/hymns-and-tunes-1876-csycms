1. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly guest,
And make thy mansion in my breast;
Dispel my doubts, my fears control,
And heal the anguish of my soul.


2. ~~Thou God of love and peace divine,
Oh, make thy light within me shine!
Forgive my sins, my guilt remove,
And send the tokens of thy love..~~^Holy Spirit God of love? Where in the scriptures?^
