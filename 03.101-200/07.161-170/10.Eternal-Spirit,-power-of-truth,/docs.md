1. Eternal Spirit, power of truth,
Our contrite hearts inspire;
Revive the flame of heavenly love,
And feed the pure desire.


2. Subdue the power of every sin,
Whate’er that sin may be,
And soothe the sorrowing, humble mind,
And set the guilty free.


3. Then with our spirits witness bear
That we are sons of God,
Redeemed from sin, from death and hell,
Through Christ’s atoning blood.
