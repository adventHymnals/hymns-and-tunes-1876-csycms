1. Come, blessed Spirit, source of light,
Whose power and grace are unconfined,
Dispel the gloomy shades of night,
The thicker darkness of the mind.


2. To my illumined eyes display
The glorious truth thy words reveal;
Cause me to run the heavenly way;
Make me delight to do thy will.


3. Thine inward teachings make me know,
The wonders of redeeming love,
The vanity of things below,
And excellence of things above.


4. While through these dubious paths I stray,
Spread, like the sun, thy beams abroad;
Oh! show the dangers of the way,
And guide my feeble steps to God.
