1. Blest Saviour, we thy will obey;—
Not of constraint, but with delight,
Thy servants hither come to-day,
To honor thine appointed rite.


2. With faith upon thy name we come,
The Spirit’s cleansing power confess;
O Saviour, from thy heavenly home,
Confirm the covenant of thy grace!


3. How blest the vow we here record!
How blest the grace we now receive!
Buried— to rise with Christ our Lord,
New lives of holiness to live.


4. Thus through the emblematic grave
The glorious, suffering Saviour trod;
He is our pattern— through the wave
We follow the blest Son of God.
