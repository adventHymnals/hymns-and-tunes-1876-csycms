1. Come, gracious Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With light and comfort from above;
Be thou our guardian, thou our guide;
O’er all our thoughts and steps preside.


2. To us the light of truth display,
And make us know and choose thy way;
Plant holy fear in every heart,
That we from God may ne’er depart.


3. Lead us to holiness— the road
Which we must take to dwell with God;
Lead us to Christ— the living way,
Nor let us from his pastures stray;


4. Lead us to God— our final rest,—
To be with him forever blest;
Lead us to Heaven, its bliss to share—
Fulness of joy forever there.
