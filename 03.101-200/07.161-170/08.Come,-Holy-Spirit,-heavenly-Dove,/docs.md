1. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all thy quick’ning powers;
Kindle a flame of sacred love
Within these hearts of ours.


2. Oh, raise our thoughts from things below,
From vanities and toys!
Then shall we with fresh courage go
To reach eternal joys.


3. Awake our souls to joyful songs;
Let pure devotions rise;
Till praise employs our thankful tongues,
And doubt forever dies.


4. Father, we would no longer live
At a poor, dying rate;
To thee our thankful love we give,—
For thine to us is great.


5. Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all thy quick’ning powers;
Come, shed abroad a Saviour’s love,
And that shall kindle ours.
