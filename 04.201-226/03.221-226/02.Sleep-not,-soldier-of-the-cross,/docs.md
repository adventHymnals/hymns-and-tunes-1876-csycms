####  Hymns and Tunes 1876

^Meter:^ ^7s^
1. Sleep not, soldier of the cross,
Foes are lurking all around;
Look not here to find repose,
This is but thy battle ground.


2. Up, and take thy shield and sword;
Up, it is the call of Heaven;
Shrink not faithless from thy Lord,
Nobly strive as he hath striven.


3. Break through all the force of ill,
Tread the might of passion down,
Struggle onward, onward still,
To the conquering Saviour’s crown.


4. Through the midst of toil and pain,
Let the thought ne’er leave thy breast,
Every triumph thou dost gain
Makes more sweet thy coming rest.
