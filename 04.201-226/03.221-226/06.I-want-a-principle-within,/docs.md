^Meter:^ ^CM^Double^
1. I want a principle within,
Of jealous, godly fear;
A sensibility of sin,
A pain to feel it near;
I want the first approach to feel,
Of pride or fond desire;
To catch the wand’ring of my will,
And quench the kindling fire.


2. From thee that I no more may part,
No more thy goodness grieve,
The filial awe, the fleshly heart,
The tender conscience give.
Quick as the apple of an eye,
O God, my conscience make;
Awake my soul when sin is nigh,
And keep it still awake.


3. If to the right or left I stray,
That moment, Lord, reprove;
And let me weep my life away,
For having grieved thy love.
Oh, may the least omission pain
My well-instructed soul!
And drive me to the blood again,
Which makes the wounded whole.
