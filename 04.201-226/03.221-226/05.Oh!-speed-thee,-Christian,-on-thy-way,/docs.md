1. Oh! speed thee, Christian, on thy way,
And to thy armor cling;
With girded loins the call obey 
That grace and mercy bring.
There is a battle to be fought,
An upward race to run,
A crown of glory to be sought,
A vict’ry to be won.


2. The shield of faith repels the dart
That Satan’s hand may throw;
His arrow cannot reach thy heart,
If Christ control the bow.
The glowing lamp of prayer will light
Thee on thy anxious road;
’Twill keep the goal of Heaven in sight,
And guide thee to thy God.
