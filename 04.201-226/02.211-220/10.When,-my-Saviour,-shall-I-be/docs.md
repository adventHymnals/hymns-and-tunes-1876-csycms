^Meter:^ ^7s^
1. When, my Saviour, shall I be
Perfectly resigned to thee?
Poor and vile in my own eyes,
Only in thy wisdom wise?


2. Only thee content to know,
Ignorant of all below?
Only guided by thy light?
Only mighty in thy might?


3. Fully in my life express
All the hights of holiness;
Sweetly let my spirit prove
All the depths of humble love.
