^Meter:^ ^SM^
1. Jesus, my strength, my hope,
On thee I cast my care,
With humble confidence look up,
And know thou hear’st my prayer.


2. I want sober mind,
A self-renouncing will,
That tramples down and casts behind
The baits of pleasing ill:


3. A soul inured to pain,
To hardship, grief, and loss;
Bold to take up, firm to sustain
The consecrated cross.


4. I want a godly fear,
A quick, discerning eye,
That looks to thee when sin is near,
And sees the tempter fly:


5. A spirit still prepared,
And armed with jealous care,
Forever standing on its guard,
And watching unto prayer.
