1. Equip me for the war,
And teach my hands to fight;
My simple, upright heart prepare,
And guide my words aright.


2. Control my every thought;
My whole of sin remove;
Let all my works in thee be wrought,
Let all be wrought in love.


3. Oh, arm me with the mind,
Meek Lamb, that was in thee!
And let my knowing zeal be joined
With perfect charity.


4. With calm and tempered zeal
Let me enforce thy call;
And vindicate thy gracious will,
Which offers life to all.


5. Oh, may I learn the art,
With meekness to reprove!
To hate the sin with all my heart,
But still the sinner love.
