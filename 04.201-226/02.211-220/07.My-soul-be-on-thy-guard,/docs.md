^Meter:^ ^SM^
1. My soul be on thy guard,
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.


2. Oh! watch, and fight, and pray;
The battle ne’er give o’er;
Renew it boldly every day,
And help divine implore.


3. Ne’er think the victory won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
Thy arduous task will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown.
