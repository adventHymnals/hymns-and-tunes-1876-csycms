1. Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,
And press with vigor on;
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
And an immortal crown.


2. ’Tis God’s all-animating voice,
That calls thee from on high;
’Tis he whose hand presents the prize
To thine aspiring eye.


3. A cloud of witnesses around
Hold thee in full survey;
Forget the steps already trod,
And onward urge thy way.


4. Blest Saviour! introduced by thee,
Our race have we begun:
And, crowned with vict’ry, at thy feet
We’ll lay our trophies down.
