1. The Spirit in our hearts,
Is whispering, Sinner, come;
The holy bride of Christ proclaims
To all her children, Come!


2. Let him that heareth say
To all about him, Come!
Let him that thirsts for righteousness,
To Christ, the fountain, come!


3. Yes, whosoever will,
Oh! let him freely come,
And freely drink the stream of life;
â€™Tis Jesus bids him come.


4. Lo! Jesus, who invites,
Declares, I quickly come:
Lord, even so, we wait thy hour;
O blest Redeemer, come.
