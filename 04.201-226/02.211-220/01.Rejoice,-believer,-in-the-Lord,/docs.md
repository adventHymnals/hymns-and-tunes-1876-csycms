1. Rejoice, believer, in the Lord,
Who makes your cause his own;
The hope that’s built upon his word
Shall ne’er be overthrown.


2. Though many foes beset your road,
And feeble is your arm,
Your life is hid with Christ in God,
Beyond the reach of harm.


3. Weak as you are, you shall not faint,
Or, fainting, shall not die;
Jesus, the strength of every saint,
Will aid you from on high.


4. Though now unseen by outward sense,
Faith sees him always near,
A guide, a glory, a defense;
What, then, have we to fear!


5. As surely as he overcame,
And triumphed once for you,
So surely you that love his name
Shall triumph in him too.
