1. How sweet, how heavenly is the sight
When those that love the Lord,
In one another’s peace delight,
And thus fulfill his word.


2. When each can feel his brother’s sigh,
And with him bear a part;
When sorrow flows from eye to eye,
And joy from heart to heart.


3. When free from envy, scorn, and pride,
Our wishes all above,
Each can his brother’s failings hide,
And show a brother’s love.


4. When love, in one delightful stream,
Through every bosom flows;
And union sweet, and dear esteem.
In every action glows.
