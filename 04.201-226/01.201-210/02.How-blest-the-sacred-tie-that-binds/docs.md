1. How blest the sacred tie that binds
In sweet communion kindred minds!
How swift the heavenly course they run,
Whose hearts, whose faith, whose hopes, are one!


2. To each the soul of each how dear!
What tender love! what holy fear!
How does the gen’rous flame within
Refine from earth, and cleanse from sin!


3. Their streaming eyes together flow,
For human guilt and human woe;
Their ardent prayers together rise,
Like mingling flames in sacrifice.


4. Together oft they seek the place,
Where God reveals his smiling face:
How high, how strong, their raptures swell,
There’s none but kindred souls can tell.
