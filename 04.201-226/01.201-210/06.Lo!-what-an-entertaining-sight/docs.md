1. Lo! what an entertaining sight
Those friendly brethren prove,
Whose cheerful hearts in bands unite
Of harmony and love!


2. Where streams of bliss from Christ, the spring,
Descend on every soul;
And heavenly peace with balmy wing
Shades and revives the whole.


3. ’Tis pleasant as the morning dews
That fall on Zion’s hill,
Where God his mildest glory shows,
And makes his grace distill.
