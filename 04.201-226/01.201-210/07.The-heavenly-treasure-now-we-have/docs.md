1. The heavenly treasure now we have
In a vile house of clay;
But Christ will to the utmost save,
And keep us to that day.


2. Our souls are in his mighty hand,
And he shall keep them still;
And you and I shall surely stand
With him on Zionâ€™s hill.


3. Oh, what a joyful meeting there!
In robes of white arrayed,
Palms in our hands we all shall bear,
And crowns upon our head.


4. Then let us lawfully contend,
And fight our passage through;
Bear in our faithful minds the end,
And keep the prize in view.
