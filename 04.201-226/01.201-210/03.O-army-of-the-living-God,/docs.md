1. O army of the living God,
Why sink your souls desponding down?
Why tremble at th’ oppressor’s rod?
Why cow’r beneath the spoiler’s frown?


2. O soldiers in the war-worn host,
Go forth in courage and in faith;
In Christ, your captain, ye may boast;
He rules the world and conquers death.


3. Go forth, and mingle in the strife
Which God commands, which Christ approves;
Go, struggle for eternal life,
And all the joys the Christian loves.


4. Soldiers of God, go forth, be strong!
Through faith do works of great renown;
Your toils and strife shall not be long;
Your Captain comes to bring your crown.
