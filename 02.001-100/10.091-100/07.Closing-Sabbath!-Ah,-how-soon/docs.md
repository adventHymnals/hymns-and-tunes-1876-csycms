1. Closing Sabbath! Ah, how soon
Have thy sacred moments passed:
Scarcely shines the morn, the noon,
Ere the evening brings thy last!
And another Sabbath flies—
Solemn witness! to the skies!


2. What is the report it bears
To the secret place of God?
Does it speak of worldly cares,
Thoughts which cling to earth’s low sod?
Or has sweet communion shone
Through its hours from God alone?


3. Could we hope the day was spent
Prayerfully, with constant heart,
We might yield it up content—,
Knowing though so soon it part,
We should see a better day,
Which could never pass away.


4. God of Sabbaths! oh, forgive!
That we use thy gifts so ill;
Teach us daily how to live,
That we ever may fulfill
All thy gracious love designed,
Giving Sabbaths to mankind.
