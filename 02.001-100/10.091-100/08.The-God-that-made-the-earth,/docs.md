1. The God that made the earth,
And all the worlds on high,
Who gave all creatures birth,
In earth, and sea, and sky,
After six days in work employed,
Upon the seventh a rest enjoyed.


2. The Sabbath day was blest,
Hallowed and sanctified;
It was Jehovah’s rest,
And so it must abide;
’Twas set apart before the fall,
’Twas made for man, ’twas made for all.


3. And when from Sinai’s mount,
Amidst the fire and smoke,
Jehovah did recount,
And all his precepts spoke;
He claimed the rest-day as his own,
And wrote it with his law on stone.


4. The Son of God appeared,
With tidings of great joy;
God’s precepts he revered,
He came not to destroy;
None of the law was set aside,
But every tittle ratified.


5. Our Saviour did not die
To render null and void,
The law of the Most High,
Which cannot be destroyed;
But, bruised for us, our stripes he bore—
We’ll go in peace and sin no more.


6. Blessed are they that do
The Father’s just commands;
They shall the city view,
Made not by human hands;
Its gates will open to the blest,
And they will share that glorious rest.
