1. In thy house while now we sing,
Tune our hearts, O heavenly King;
Then our joyful souls shall bless
Thee, the Lord, our righteousness.


2. While to thee our prayers ascend,
Let thine ear in love attend;
Hear us; for thy Spirit pleads:
Hear; for Jesus intercedes.


3. While we hear thy word with awe,
While we tremble at thy law,
Let thy gospelâ€™s wondrous love
Every doubt and fear remove.


4. ==From thy house when we return,
Let our hearts within us burn;
That at evening we may say,
We have walked with God to-day.==
