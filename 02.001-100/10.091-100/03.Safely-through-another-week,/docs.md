1. Safely through another week,
God has brought us on our way;
Let us now a blessing seek,
Waiting in his courts to-day:
Day of all the week the best!
Emblem of eternal rest!


2. While we seek supplies of grace,
Through the dear Redeemer’s name, 
Show thy reconciling face,
Take away our sin and shame;
From our worldly cares set free,
May we rest this day in thee.


3. ==Here we come, thy name to praise;==
May we feel thy presence n ear;
May thy glory meet our eyes 
While we in thy courts appear.
Here afford us, Lord, a taste 
Of our everlasting feast.


4. May thy gospel’s joyful sound
Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
Make the fruits of grace abound,
Bring relief to all complaints:
Thus may all our Sabbaths be,
Till we rise to reign with thee.
