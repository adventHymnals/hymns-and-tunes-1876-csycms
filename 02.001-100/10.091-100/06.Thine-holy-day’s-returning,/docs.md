1. Thine holy day’s returning,
Our hearts exult to see,
And, with devotion burning,
Ascend, great God, to thee.
To-day with purest pleasure,
Our thoughts from earth withdraw;
We search for heavenly treasure
We learn thy holy law.


2. We join to sing thy praises,
O  God of Sabbath day!
Each voice in gladness raises 
Its loudest, sweetest lay. 
Thy richest mercies sharing— 
Inspire us with thy love;
By grace our souls preparing 
For nobler praise above.
