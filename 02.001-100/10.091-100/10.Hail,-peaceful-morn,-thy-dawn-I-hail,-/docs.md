1. Hail, peaceful morn, thy dawn I hail, 
How do thy hours my mind regale
With feasts of heavenly joy;
Nor can I half thy blessings name, 
Which kindle in my soul a flame,
And all my powers employ.


2. How shall I best improve thy hours? 
Lord, on me shed in copious showers
Thy Spirit and thy grace;
That when thy sacred courts I tread, 
My soul may eat the heavenly bread, 
And sing Jehovah’s praise.


3. Thou hallowed season of repose,
Thou balm to soothe the throbbing woes 
Of this care-stricken breast;
Thy sacred hours I’ll ever greet,
And with the faithful will I meet,
To taste thy holy rest.


4. Thus may the Sabbath pass away,
My best, my holiest, happiest day,
The sweetest of the seven;
But yet a rest for saints remains,
The Sabbath free from ills and pains, 
Eternal, and in Heaven.
