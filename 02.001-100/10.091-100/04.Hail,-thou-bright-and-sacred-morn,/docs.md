1. Hail, thou bright and sacred morn,
Risen with gladness in thy beams!
Light, which not of earth is born,
From thy dawn in glory streams;
Airs of heaven are breathed around,
And each place is holy ground.


2. Great Creator! who this day
From thy perfect work didst rest;
By the souls that own thy sway,
Hallowed be its hours and blest;
Cares of earth aside be thrown,
This day given to God alone!
