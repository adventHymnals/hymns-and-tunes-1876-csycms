1. THE light of Sabbath eve
Is fading fast away;
What record will it for us leave,
To crown the closing day?


2. Is it a Sabbath spent,
Of fruitless time destroyed?
Or have these moments to us lent,
Been sacredly employed?


3. To waste these Sabbath hours,
Oh! may we never dare;
Nor desecrate with words of ours
These sacred days of prayer.


4. But may our Sabbaths here
Inspire our hearts with love;
And prove a blessed foretaste clear,
Of that sweet rest above.
