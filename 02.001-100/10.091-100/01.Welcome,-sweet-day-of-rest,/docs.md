1. Welcome, sweet day of rest,
The day believers prize;
Welcome to this reviving breast,
And these rejoicing eyes.


2. The King himself comes near,
And feasts his saints to-day;
Here we may sit, and see him here,
And love, and praise, and pray.


3. One day within the place
Where Christ, my Lord, has been,
Is sweeter than ten thousand days
Of folly and of sin.


4. My willing soul would stay
In such a frame as this,
Till called to rise and soar away
To everlasting bliss.
