1. O Bow thine ear, Eternal One!
On thee our heart adoring calls;
To thee the followers of thy Son
Have raised, and now devote, these walls.


2. Here let thy holy days be kept;
And be this place to worship given,
Like that bright spot where Jacob slept,
The house of God, the gate of Heaven.


3. Here may thine honor dwell; and here
As incense, let thy children’s prayer,
From contrite hearts and lips sincere,
Rise on the still and holy air.


4. Here be thy praise devoutly sung;
Here let thy truth beam forth to save,
As when, of old, thy Spirit hung,
On wings of light, o’er Jordan’s wave.
