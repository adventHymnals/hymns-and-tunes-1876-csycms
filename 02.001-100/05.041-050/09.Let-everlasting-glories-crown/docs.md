1. Let everlasting glories crown
Thy head, my Saviour and my Lord;
Thy hands have brought salvation down,
And stored the blessings in thy word.


2. In vain the trembling conscience seeks
Some solid ground to rest upon;
With deep distress the spirit breaks,
Till we apply to Christ alone.


3. How well thy blessed truths agree!
How wise and holy thy commands!
Thy promises, how firm they be,
How sure our hope and comfort stands!


4. Should all the forms that men devise
Assault my faith with treach’rous art,
I’d call them vanity and lies,
And bind the gospel to my heart.
