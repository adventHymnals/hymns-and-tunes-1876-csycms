1. Praise the Lord! ye heavens adore him,
Praise him, angels in the height;
Sun and moon rejoice before him:
Praise him, all ye stars of light!


2. Praise the Lord, for he hath spoken:
Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;
Laws which never shall be broken,
For their guidance he hath made.


3. Praise the Lord, for he is glorious;
Never shall his promise fail;
God hath made his saints victorious,
Sin and death shall not prevail.


4. Praise the God of our salvation,
Hosts on high his power proclaim;
Heaven and earth, and all creation,
Laud and magnify his name.
