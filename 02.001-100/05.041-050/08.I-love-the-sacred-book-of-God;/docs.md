1. I love the sacred book of God;
No other can its place supply;
It points me to the saints’ abode,
And bids me from destruction fly.


2. Sweet book! in thee my eyes discern
The image of my absent Lord;
From thine instructive page I learn
The joys his presence will afford.


3. But while I’m here, thou shalt supply
His place, and tell me of his love;
I’ll read with faith’s discerning eye,
And thus partake of joys above.


4. In thee I read my title clear
To mansions that will ne’er decay;
Dear Lord, oh, when wilt thou appear,
And bear my longing soul away!


5. Let now in them thy Spirit move
To animate thy people here;
And may these truths our guardian prove,
Till in thy presence we appear.
