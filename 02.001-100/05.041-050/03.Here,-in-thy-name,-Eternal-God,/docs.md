1. Here, in thy name, Eternal God,
We build this earthly house for thee;
Oh! choose it for thy fixed abode,
And guard it long from error free.


2. When here, O Lord, we seek thy face,
And dying sinners pray to live,
Hear thou in Heaven, thy dwelling-place,
And when thou hearest, Lord, forgive.


3. When here thy messengers proclaim
The blessed gospel of thy Son,
Still, by the power of his great name,
Be mighty signs and wonders done.


4. And when our voices raise the song,
Hosanna! to our heavenly King,
Let Heaven with earth the strain prolong;
Hosanna! let the angels sing.
