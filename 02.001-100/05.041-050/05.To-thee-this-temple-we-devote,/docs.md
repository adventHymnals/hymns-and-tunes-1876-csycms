1. To thee this temple we devote,
Our Father and our God;
Accept it thine, and seal it now
Thy Spirit’s blest abode.


2. Here may the prayer of faith ascend,
The voice of praise arise;
And may each lowly service prove
Accepted sacrifice.


3. Here may the sinner learn his guilt,
And weep before his Lord;
Here, pardoned, sing a Saviour’s love,
And here his vows record.


4. Peace be within these sacred walls;
Prosperity be here;
Oh, smile upon thy people, Lord,
And evermore be near.
