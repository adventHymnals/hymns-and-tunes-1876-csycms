1. ’Twas by an order from the Lord
The ancient prophets spoke his word;
His Spirit did their tongues inspire,
And warm their hearts with heavenly fire.


2. Great God! mine eyes with pleasure look
On the dear volume of thy book;
There my Redeemer’s face I see,
And read his name who died for me.


3. Let the false raptures of the mind
Be lost, and vanish in the wind;
Here I can fix my hope secure,
This is thy word, and must endure.
