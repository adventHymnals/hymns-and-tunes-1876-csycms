1. God is the refuge of his saints,
When storms of sharp distress invade:
Ere we can offer our complaints,
Behold him present with his aid.


2. Loud may the troubled ocean roar;
In sacred peace our souls abide;
While every nation, every shore,
Trembles and dreads the swelling tide.


3. There is a stream whose gentle flow
Supplies the city of our God;
Life, love, and joy, still gliding through,
And watering our divine abode.


4. Zion enjoys her Monarchâ€™s love,
Secure against a threatening hour;
Nor can her firm foundation move.
Built on his truth, and armed with power.
