1. O Thou, to whom, in ancient time,
The psalmist’s sacred harp was strung,
Whom kings adored in song sublime,
And prophets praised with glowing tongue,—


2. Not now on Zion’s height alone 
Thy favored worshipers may dwell,
Nor where, at sultry noon, thy Son
Sat weary by the patriarch’s well.


3. From every place below the skies,
The grateful song, the fervent prayer—
The incense of the heart,—may rise
To Heaven, and find acceptance there.


4. To thee shall age, with snowy hair,
And strength, and beauty, bend the knee,
And childhood lisp, with reverent air,
Its praises and its prayers to thee.
