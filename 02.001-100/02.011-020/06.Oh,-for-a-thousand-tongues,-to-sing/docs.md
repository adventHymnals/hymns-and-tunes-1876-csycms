1. Oh, for a thousand tongues, to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise!
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of his grace.


2. My gracious Master, and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
The honors of thy name.


3. Jesus, the name that calms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease!
’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
’Tis life, and health, and peace.


4. He breaks ==the cruel power of sin,==
He sets the pris’ner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood avails for me.


5. He speaks, and list’ning to his voice,
New life the dead receive;
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice;
The humble poor believe.


6. Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.
