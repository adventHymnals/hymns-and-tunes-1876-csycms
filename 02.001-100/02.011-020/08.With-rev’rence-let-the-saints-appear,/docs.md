1. With rev’rence let the saints appear,
And bow before the Lord;
His high commands with rev’rence hear,
And tremble at his word.


2. How terrible thy glories be!
How bright thine armies shine!
Where is the power that vies with thee
Or truth compared with thine?


3. Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord,
Your great Deliv’rer sing;
Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound,
Be joyful in your King.


4. O Jesus, Lord of earth and heaven,
Our life and joy, to thee
Be honor, thanks, and blessing given
Through all eternity.
