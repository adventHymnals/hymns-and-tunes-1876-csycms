1. What various hindrances we meet,
In coming to the mercy-seat;
Yet, who that knows the worth of prayer,
But wishes to be often there.


2. Prayer makes the darkest cloud withdraw;
Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw,
Gives exercise to faith and love,
Brings every blessing from above.


3. Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;
Prayer makes the Christian’s armor bright;
And Satan trembles when he sees
The weakest saint upon his knees.


4. When Moses stood with arms spread wide,
Success was found on Israel’s side;
But when, through weariness, they failed,
That moment Amalek prevailed.


5. Have you no words? Ah! think again;
Words flow apace when you complain,
And fill your fellow-creatures’ ears
With the sad tale of all your cares.


6. Were half the breath thus vainly spent,
To Heaven in supplication sent,
Your cheerful song would oftener be,
Hear what the Lord hath done for me!
