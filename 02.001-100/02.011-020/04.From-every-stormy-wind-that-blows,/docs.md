1. From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat,
’Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.


2. There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads;
A place than all besides more sweet—
It is the blood-bought mercy-seat.


3. There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy-seat.


4. Ah! whither should we flee for aid,
When tempted, desolate, dismayed,
Or how the hosts of hell defeat,
Had suffering saints no mercy-seat?


5. There, there on angels’ wings we soar,
And sin and sense seem all no more;
The Lord comes down, our souls to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy-seat.


6. Oh! let my hand forget her skill,
My tongue be silent, cold and still,
This bounding heart forget to beat,
If I forget the mercy-seat.
