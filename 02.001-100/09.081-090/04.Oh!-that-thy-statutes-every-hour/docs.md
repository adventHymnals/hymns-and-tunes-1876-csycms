1. Oh! that thy statutes every hour
Might dwell upon my mind;
Thence I derive a quick’ning power,
And daily peace I find.


2. To meditate thy precepts, Lord,
Shall be my sweet employ;
My soul shall ne’er forget thy word;
Thy word is all my joy.


3. My lips with courage shall declare
Thy statutes and thy name;
I’ll speak thy word, though kings should hear,
Nor yield to sinful shame.
