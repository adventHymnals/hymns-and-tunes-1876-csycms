1. Blest are the undefiled in heart,
Whose ways are right and clean;
Who never from thy law depart,
But fly from every sin.


2. Blest are the men who keep thy word,
And practice thy commands;
With their whole heart they seek the Lord,
And serve thee with their hands.


3. Great is their peace who love thy law;
How firm their souls abide!
Nor can a bold temptation draw
Their steady feet aside.


4. Then shall my heart have inward joy,
And keep my face from shame,
When all thy statutes I obey,
And honor all thy name.
