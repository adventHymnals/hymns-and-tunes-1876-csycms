1. Thy law is perfect, Lord of light;
Thy testimonies sure;
The statutes of thy realm are right,
And thy commandments pure.


2. Let these, O God, my soul convert,
And make thy servant wise;
Let these be gladness to my heart,
The dayspring to mine eyes.


3. By these may I be warned betimes;
Who knows the guile within?
Lord, save me from presumptuous crimes, 
Cleanse me from secret sin.


4. So may the words my lips express,
The thoughts that throng my mind,
O Lord, my strength and righteousness, 
With thee acceptance find.
