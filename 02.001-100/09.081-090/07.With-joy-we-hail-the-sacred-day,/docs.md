1. With joy we hail the sacred day,
Which God has called his own;
With joy the summons we obey,
To worship at his throne.


2. Thy chosen temple, Lord, how fair!
Where willing votaries throng
To breathe the humble, fervent prayer,
And pour the choral song.


3. Spirit of grace, O deign to dwell
Within thy church below;
Make her in holiness excel,
With pure devotion glow.


4. Let peace within her walls be found;
Let all her sons unite
To spread with grateful zeal around,
Her clear and shining light.
