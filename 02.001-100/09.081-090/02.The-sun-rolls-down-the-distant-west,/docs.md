1. The sun rolls down the distant west,
Soft twilight steals abroad,
To welcome in the day of rest,
The Sabbath of our Lord.


2. This holy day let us begin
With songs of praise to God,
Who pardons all our guilt and sin,
Through Jesus’ precious blood.


3. Now in this tranquil hour we lay
All worldly cares aside,
And hallow God’s most holy day,
Though friends or foes may chide.
