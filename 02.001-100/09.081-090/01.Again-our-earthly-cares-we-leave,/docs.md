1. Again our earthly cares we leave,
And to thy courts repair;
Again with joyful feet we haste,
To meet our Saviour there.


2. Great Shepherd of thy people, here!
Thy presence now display;
We bow within thy house of prayer;
Oh! give us hearts to pray.


3. The clouds which vail thee from our sight
In pity, Lord, remove;
Dispose our minds to hear aright
The message of thy love.


4. The feeling heart, the melting eye,
The humble mind bestow;
And shine upon us from above,
To make our graces grow.
