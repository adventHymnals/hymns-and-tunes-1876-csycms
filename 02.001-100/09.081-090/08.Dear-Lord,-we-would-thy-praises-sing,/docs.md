1. Dear Lord, we would thy praises sing,
On this thy holy day;
With grateful hearts our tribute bring, 
And to thee homage pay.


2. This day, which thou for us hast blest
And set apart as thine;
This day, when God himself did rest 
Hath honors all divine.


3. Lord, we would turn away our feet
From this thy holy day,
And call its rest and worship sweet,
A ot doing our own way.


4. That we may thus restore the breach
Which in thy law is made,
We need thy grace our hearts to teach,
We need thy Spiritâ€™s aid.


5. Oh! give us wisdom from above
To worship thee aright,
Till we shall meet Him whom we love,
And faith is lost in sight.
