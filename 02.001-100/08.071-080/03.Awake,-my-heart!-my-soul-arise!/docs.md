1. Awake, my heart! my soul arise!
This is the day believers prize;
Improve this Sabbath, then, with care; 
Another may not be thy share.


2. Oh, solemn thought! Lord, give me power, 
Wisely to fill up every hour;
O h! for the wings of faith and love 
To bear my longing heart above!


3. Jesus, assist, nor let me fail
To worship thee within the vail;
To glorify thy matchless grace;
To see the beauties of thy face.


4. Be with me in thy house to-day,
And tune my heart to praise and pray; 
Command thy word to fall like dew, 
Refreshing, quick’ning all anew.


5. Call forth my thoughts, and let them rove 
O’er the green pastures of thy love;
Oh! let not sin prevent my rest.
Nor keep me from my Saviour’s breast.
