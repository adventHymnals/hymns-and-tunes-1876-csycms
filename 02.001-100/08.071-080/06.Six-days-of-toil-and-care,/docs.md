1. Six days of toil and care,
I bid you all adieu;
And now, O peaceful, Sabbath hours,
I gladly welcome you.


2. My heart with rapture turns
To Eden’s vale so fair;
Then forward to the heavenly world,
And views the Sabbath there.


3. Sweet day of rest, through thee
Shall memory faithful prove
To Him who made the earth and sea,
And starry worlds above.


4. Each Sabbath spent aright
Shall bring us nearer thee,
Till in that glorious land of light
W e’re made forever free.
