1. Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
To praise thy name, give thanks, and sing;
To show thy love by morning light,
And talk of all thy truth by night.


2. Sweet is the day of sacred rest;
No mortal cares shall seize my breast;
Oh! may my heart in tune be found,
Like Davidâ€™s harp of solemn sound.


3. My heart shall triumph in the Lord
And bless his works, and bless his word;
Thy works of grace how bright they shine!
How deep thy counsels, how divine!


4. When grace has purified my heart,
Then I shall share a glorious part;
And fresh supplies of joy be shed,
Like holy oil to cheer my head.


5. Then shall I see, and hear, and know,
All I desired or wished below;
And every hour find sweet employ,
In that eternal world of joy.
