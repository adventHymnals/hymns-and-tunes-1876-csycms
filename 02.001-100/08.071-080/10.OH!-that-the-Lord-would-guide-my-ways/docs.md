1. OH! that the Lord would guide my ways
To keep his statutes still;
Oh! that my God would grant me grace
To know and do his will.


2. O send thy Spirit down to write
Thy law upon my heart;
Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,
Nor act the liar’s part.


3. From vanity turn off my eyes;
Let no corrupt design.
Nor covetous desires, arise
Within this soul of mine.


4. Order my footsteps by thy word,
And make my heart sincere;
Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
But keep my conscience clear.


5. Make me to walk in thy commands—
’Tis a delightful road;
Nor let my head, nor heart, nor hands,
Offend against my God.
