1. Glory to God on high!
Ye harpers of the sky,
Praise ye his name!
Ye saints his love adore,
Who all your sorrows bore;
Sing joyful, evermore,
Worthy the Lamb.


2. While they around the throne
Cheerfully join in one,
Praising his name,—
Ye who have felt his blood
Sealing your peace with God,
Sound his dear name abroad,
Worthy the Lamb!


3. Join, all ye ransomed race,
Our Lord and God to bless;
Praise ye his name!
In him we will rejoice,
And make a joyful noise,
Shouting with heart and voice,
Worthy the Lamb!


4. Soon shall we see his face,
And in that heavenly place,
W e’ll praise his name:
To him our songs we’ll bring;
Hail him our gracious King;
And, through all ages sing,
Worthy the Lamb!
