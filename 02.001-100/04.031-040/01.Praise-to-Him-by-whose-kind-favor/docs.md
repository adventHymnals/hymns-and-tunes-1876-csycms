1. Praise to Him by whose kind favor
Heavenly truth has reached our ears;
May its sweet reviving savor
Fill our hearts, and calm our fears.


2. Truth! how sacred is the treasure!
Teach us, Lord, its worth to know;
Vain the hope, and short the pleasure,
Which from other sources flow.


3. What of truth we have been hearing,
Fix, O Lord, in every heart;
In the day of thine appearing,
May we share thy peopleâ€™s part.


4. Till we leave this world forever,
May we live beneath thine eye;
This our aim, our sole endeavor,
Thine to live, and thine to die.
