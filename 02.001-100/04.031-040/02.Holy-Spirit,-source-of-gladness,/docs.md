1. Holy Spirit, source of gladness,
Shine amid the clouds of night;
O’er our weariness and sadness
Breathe thy life and shed thy light;


2. Send us thine illumination;
Banish all our fears at length;
Rest upon this congregation,
Spirit of unfailing strength.


3. Let that love which knows no measure,
Now in quick’ning showers descend,
Bringing us the richest treasure
Man can wish or God can send:


4. Hear our earnest supplication;
Every struggling heart release;
Rest upon this congregation,
Spirit of eternal peace.
