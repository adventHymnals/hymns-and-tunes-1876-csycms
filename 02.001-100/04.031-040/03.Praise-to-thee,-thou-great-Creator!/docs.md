1. Praise to thee, thou great Creator!
Praise to thee from every tongue;
Join, my soul, with every creature,
Join the universal song.


2. Father, source of all compassion,
Pure, unbounded grace is thine:
Hail the God of our salvation,
Praise him for his love divine!


3. For thy countless blessings given,
For the hope of future joy,
Sound his name through earth and Heaven,
Let his praise your tongues employ.


4. Joyfully on earth adore him,
Till in Heaven our song we raise:
Then enraptured fall before him,
Lost in wonder, love, and praise!
