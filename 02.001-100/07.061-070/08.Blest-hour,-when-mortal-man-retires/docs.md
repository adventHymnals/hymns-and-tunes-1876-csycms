1. Blest hour, when mortal man retires
To hold communion with his God,
To send to Heaven his warm desires,
And listen to the sacred word.


2. Blest hour, when earthly cares resign
Their empire o’er his anxious breast,
While all around the calm divine
Proclaims the holy day of rest.


3. Blest hour, when God himself draws nigh,
Well pleased his people’s voice to hear,
To hush the penitential sigh,
And wipe away the mourner’s tear.


4. Blest hour! for, where the Lord resorts,
Foretastes of future bliss are given;
And mortals find his earthly courts
The house of God, the gate of Heaven.
