1. Delightful day! first gift of Heaven
To man, of Eden then possessed,
Jehovah’s rest-day, kindly given
That all his creatures might be blessed.


2. Memorial of creation’s King,
We welcome now thy glad return;
And while his praise we join to sing,
Our hearts with love and rapture burn.


3. We bless thy name, almighty Lord,
We love the keepsake thou hast given;
Our voices raise with one accord,
In honor of the King of Heaven.


4. All praise to Jesus, by whose blood
We are redeemed from sin and death;
Give glory to the Son of God—
Praise him all creatures that have breath.


5. By sin we are exposed to wrath;
He died for us, that he might draw
Our wandering feet to virtue’s path,
Where we may keep God’s holy law.


6. That law shall still be our delight,
The holy Sabbath is a part,
And when we gain that world so bright,
All flesh shall keep it with one heart.
