1. Thy precepts often I survey;
I keep thy law in sight,
Through all the business of the day,
To form my actions right.


2. My heart in midnight silence cries,
How sweet thy comforts be!
My thoughts in holy wonder rise,
And bring their thanks to thee.


3. And when my spirit drinks her fill
At some good word of thine,
Not mighty men that share the spoil,
Have joys compared with mine.
