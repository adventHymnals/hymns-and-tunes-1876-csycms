1. Come, dearest Lord, and feed thy sheep,
On this sweet day of rest;
Oh! bless this flock, and make this fold
Enjoy a heavenly rest.


2. Welcome and precious to my soul
Are these sweet days of love;
But what a Sabbath shall I keep
When I shall rest above!


3. I come, I wait, I hear, I pray;
Thy footsteps, Lord, I trace;
Here, in thine own appointed way,
I wait to see thy face.


4. These are the sweet and precious days
On which my Lord I’ve seen,
And oft, when feasting on his word,
In raptures I have been.


5. Oh! if my soul, when Christ appears,
In this sweet frame be found,
I’ll clasp my Saviour in mine arms,
And leave this earthly ground.
