1. Thou book of life, in thee are found
The mysteries of my Maker’s will;
Treasures of knowledge here abound,
The deepest, loftiest mind to fill.


2. Light of the world, thy beams impart
To lead my feet through life’s dark way;
Oh! shine on this benighted heart,
Nor let me from thy guidance stray.
