1. We’ve entered now on holy time,
God’s blessed rest-day all divine;
The labors of the week are past,
Now let earth’s cares aside be cast.


2. Oh! let us help repair the breach,
And all of God’s commandments teach,
Calling his rest-day our delight,
Thus walking blameless in his sight.


3. This holy rest to us is given,
To call our minds from earth to Heaven;
That we may not forget the Lord,
And trample down his holy word.


4. The faith of Jesus, too, we need;
For thus the flying angel said:
Commands of God and Jesus’ faith
Will shield us in the day of wrath.
