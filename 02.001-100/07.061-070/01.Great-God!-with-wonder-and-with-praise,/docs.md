1. Great God! with wonder and with praise,
On all thy works I look;
But still thy wisdom, power and grace,
Shine brightest in thy book.


2. Lord, make me understand thy law;
Show what my faults have been;
And from thy gospel let me draw
Forgiveness for my sin.


3. Here I would learn how Christ has died,
To save my soul from hell;
Not all the books on earth beside,
Such heavenly wonders tell.


4. Here are my choicest treasures hid;
Here my best comfort lies;
Here my desires are satisfied;
And here my hopes arise.


5. When nature sinks, and spirits droop,
The promises of grace
Are pillars to support my hope,
And there I write thy praise.
