1. Father of mercies, in thy word
What endless glory shines!
Forever be thy name adored
For these celestial lines.


2. Here the Redeemer’s welcome voice
Spreads heavenly peace around;
And life, and everlasting joys
Attend the blissful sound.


3. Jesus, thy word with friendly aid
Restores our wand’ring feet.
Converts the sorrows of the mind
To joys divinely sweet.


4. Oh! may these heavenly pages be
My ever dear delight;
And still new beauties may I see,
And still increasing light.


5. Divine Instructor, gracious Lord,
Be thou forever near;
Teach me to love thy sacred word,
And view my Saviour here.
