1. Blessed Bible, how I love it!
How it doth my bosom cheer!
What hath earth like this to covet?
Oh! what stores of wealth are here.


2. ’Tis a fountain ever bursting,
Whence the weary may obtain
Water for the soul that’s thirsting,
And shall never thirst again.


3. ’Tis a chart that never fails you,
One which God to man has given;
And though rudest storms assail you,
It will guide you safe to Heaven.


4. ’Tis a pearl of price, exceeding
All the gems in ocean found;
To its precepts ever listen,
In its truths may you abound.
