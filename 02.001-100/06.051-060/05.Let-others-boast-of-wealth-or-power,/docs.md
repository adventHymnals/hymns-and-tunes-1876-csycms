1. Let others boast of wealth or power,
And glory in their pride;
Thy word, O God, we value more
Than all the world beside.


2. Here mines of knowledge, love, and joy,
Are open to our sight;
The purest gold without alloy,
And gems divinely bright.


3. The counsels of redeeming grace
These sacred leaves unfold,
And here the Saviourâ€™s lovely face
Our raptured eyes behold.


4. Here light descending from above
Directs our doubtful feet;
Here promises of heavenly love
Our ardent wishes meet.
