^Meter:^ ^SM^
1. How perfect is thy word,
Thy judgments all are just;
And ever in thy promise, Lord,
May man securely trust.


2. I hear thy word in love,
In faith thy word obey;
Oh! send thy Spirit from above,
To teach me, Lord, thy way.


3. Thy counsels all are plain,
Thy precepts all are pure;
And long as Heaven and earth remain,
The truth shall still endure.


4. Oh! may my soul with joy
Trust in thy faithful word;
Be it through life my glad employ,
To keep thy precepts, Lord.
