1. How shall the young secure their hearts,
And guard their lives from sin?
Thy word the choicest rules imparts
To keep the conscience clean.


2. ’Tis like the sun, a heavenly light,
That guides us all the day;
And through the dangers of the night,
A lamp to lead our way.


3. Thy precepts make me truly wise;
I hate the sinner’s road;
I hate my own vain thoughts that rise,
But love thy law, my God!


4. Thy word is everlasting truth;
How pure is every page!
That holy book shall guide our youth,
And well support our age.
