1. With my whole heart I’ve sought thy face,
Oh! let me never stray
From thy commands, O God of grace,
Nor tread the sinner’s way.


2. Thy word I’ve hid within my heart,
To keep my conscience clean,
And be an everlasting guard
From every rising sin.


3. My heart with sacred rev’rence hears
The threatenings of thy word;
My flesh, with holy trembling, fears
The judgments of the Lord.


4. My God! I long, I hope, I wait,
For thy salvation still;
While thy whole law is my delight,
And I obey thy will.
