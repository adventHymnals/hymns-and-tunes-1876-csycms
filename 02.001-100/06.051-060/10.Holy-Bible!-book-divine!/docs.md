1. Holy Bible! book divine!
Precious treasure, thou art mine!
Mine, to tell me whence I came;
Mine, to teach me what I am;


2. Mine, to chide me when I rove;
Mine, to show a Saviour’s love;
Mine, art thou to guide my feet;
Mine, to judge, condemn, acquit;


3. Mine, to comfort in distress,
If the Holy Spirit bless;
Mine, to show, by living faith,
Man can triumph over death;


4. Mine, to tell of joys to come,
And the rebel sinner’s doom;
O thou holy book divine!
Precious treasure, thou art mine!
