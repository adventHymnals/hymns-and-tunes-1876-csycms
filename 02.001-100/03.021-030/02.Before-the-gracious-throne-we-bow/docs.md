1. Before the gracious throne we bow
Of Heaven’s almighty King;
We here present the solemn vow,
And hymns of praise we sing.


2. O Lord, while ==in thy house we kneel,==
With trust and holy fear;
Thy mercy and thy truth reveal,
And lend a gracious ear.


3. With fervor teach our hearts to pray,
And tune our lips to sing;
Nor from thy presence cast away
The sacrifice we bring.
