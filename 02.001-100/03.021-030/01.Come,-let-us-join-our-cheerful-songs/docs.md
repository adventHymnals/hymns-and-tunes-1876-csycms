1. Come, let us join our cheerful songs
With angels round the throne;
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
But all their joys are one.


2. Worthy the Lamb who died, they cry,
To be exalted thus:
Worthy the Lamb, our hearts reply,
For he was slain for us.


3. Jesus is worthy to receive
Honor and power divine;
And blessings more than we can give,
Be, Lord, forever thine.


4. To Him who reigns in worlds of light,
The eternal King of Heaven,
Be honor, majesty, and might,
And praise and glory given.


5. Let all creation join in one
To bless the sacred name
Of Him who sits upon the throne,
And to adore the Lamb.
