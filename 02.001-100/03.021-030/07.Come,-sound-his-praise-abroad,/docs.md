1. Come, sound his praise abroad,
And hymns of glory sing;
Jehovah is the sov’reign God,
The universal King.


2. Come, worship at his throne,
Come, bow before the Lord;
We are his work, and not our own,
He formed us by his word.


3. To-day attend his voice,
Nor dare provoke his rod;
Come, like the people of his choice,
And own your gracious God,
