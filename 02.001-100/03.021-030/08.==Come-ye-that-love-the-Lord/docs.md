1. ==Come ye that love the Lord
And let your joys be known;
Join in a song of sweet accord,
While ye surround his throne.==


2. Let those refuse to sing,
Who never knew our God;
But servants of the Heavenly King
May speak their joys abroad.


3. The God that rules on high,
That all the earth surveys,
That rides upon the stormy sky,
And calms the roaring seas:


4. This awful God is ours,
Our Father and our Love;
He will send down his heavenly powers,
To carry us above.


5. There we shall see his face,
And never, never sin;
There, from the rivers of his grace
Drink endless pleasures in.


6. Yea, and before we rise
To that immortal state,
The thought of such amazing bliss
Should constant joys create.
