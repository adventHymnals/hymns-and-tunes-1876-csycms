1. Thou art my portion, O my God!
Soon as I know thy way,
My heart makes haste t’ obey thy word,
And suffers no delay.


2. I choose the path of heavenly truth,
And glory in my choice;
Not all the riches of the earth
Could make me so rejoice.


3. The testimonies of thy grace
I set before mine eyes;
Thence I derive my daily strength,
And there my comfort lies.


4. If once I wander from thy path,
I think upon my ways;
Then turn my feet to thy commands,
And trust thy pardoning grace.


5. Now I am thine— forever thine,—
Oh, save thy servant, Lord!
Thou art my shield, my hiding-place,
My hope is in thy word.
