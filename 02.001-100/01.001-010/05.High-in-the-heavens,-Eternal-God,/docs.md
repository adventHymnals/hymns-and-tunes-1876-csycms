^Meter:^ ^LM^
1. High in the heavens, Eternal God,
Thy goodness in full glory shines;
Thy truth shall break through every cloud
That veils thy just and wise designs.


2. Forever firm thy justice stands,
As mountains their foundations keep;
Wise as the wonders of thy hands,
Thy judgments are a mighty deep.


3. O God, how excellent thy grace,
Whence all our hope and comfort spring!
The sons of Adam, in distress,
Fly to the shadow of thy wing.


4. In the provisions of thy house
We still shall find a sweet repast;
There mercy like a river flows,
And brings salvation to our taste.


5. Life, like a fountain, rich and free,
Springs from the presence of my Lord;
And in thy light our souls shall see
The glories promised in thy word.
