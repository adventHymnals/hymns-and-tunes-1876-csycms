1. Not all the nobles of the earth,
Who boast the honors of their birth,
So high a dignity can claim,
As those who bear the Christian name.


2. To them the privilege is given
To be the sons and heirs of Heaven;
Sons of the God who reigns on high,
And heirs of joy beyond the sky.


3. He teaches their young feet the way,
And early leads them to obey;
Whispers instruction to their minds,
And on their hearts his precepts binds.


4. Their daily wants his hands supply,
Their steps he guards with watchful eye;
Leads them from earth to Heaven above,
And crowns them with eternal love.
