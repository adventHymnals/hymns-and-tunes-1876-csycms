1. Servants of God, in joyful lays,
Sing ye the Lord Jehovah’s praise;
His glorious name let all adore,
From age to age, for evermore.


2. Blest be his name, supremely blest,
From the sun’s rising to its rest,
Who in the riches of his grace,
Looks down upon the human race.


3. He hears the uncomplaining moan
Of those who sit and weep alone;
He lifts the mourner from the dust;
In him the poor may safely trust.


4. Oh! then, aloud, in joyful lays,
Sing to the Lord Jehovah’s praise:
His saving name let all adore,
From age to age, for evermore.
