1. Before Jehovah’s awful throne,
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy:
Know that the Lord is God alone:
He can create, and he destroy.


2. His sovereign power, without our aid,
Made us of clay, and formed us men:
And when, like wandering sheep, we strayed,
He brought us to his fold again.


3. We’ll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
High as the heavens our voices raise;
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.


4. Wide as the world is thy command:
Vast as eternity thy love:
Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move.
