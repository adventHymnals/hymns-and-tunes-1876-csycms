1. Almighty Father, bless the word,
Which, through thy grace, we now have heard;
Oh! may the precious seed take root,
Spring up, and bear abundant fruit.


2. We praise thee for the means of grace,
Thus in thy courts to seek thy face;
Grant, Lord, that we who worship here,
May all, at length, in Heaven appear.
