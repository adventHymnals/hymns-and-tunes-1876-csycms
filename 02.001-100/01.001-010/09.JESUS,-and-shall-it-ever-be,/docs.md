1. JESUS, and shall it ever be,
A mortal man ashamed of thee?
Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,
Whose glories shine through endless days?


2. Ashamed of Jesus! that dear friend
On whom my hopes of Heaven depend!
No; when I blush, be this my shame,
That I no more revere his name.


3. Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may,
When I â€™ve no guilt to wash away,
No tears to wipe, no good to crave,
No fears to quell, no soul to save.


4. Till then, nor is my boasting vain,
Till then, I boast a Saviour slain;
And, oh! may this my glory be,
That Christ is not ashamed of me.
