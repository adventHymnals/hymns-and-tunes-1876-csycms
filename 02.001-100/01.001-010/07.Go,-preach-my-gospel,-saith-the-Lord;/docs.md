1. Go, preach my gospel, saith the Lord;
Bid the whole world my grace receive;
He shall be saved who trusts my word;
And they condemned who disbelieve.


2. I’ll make your great commission known,
And ye shall prove my gospel true
By all the works that I have done,
By all the wonders ye shall do.


3. Teach all the nations my commands;
I’m with you till the world shall end;
All power is vested in my hands;
I can destroy, and I defend.


4. He spake, and light shone round his head:
On a bright cloud to Heaven he rode:
They to the farthest nations spread
The grace of their ascended Lord.
