1. Lord, grant thy blessing here to-day;
Oh! give thy people joy and peace;
The tokens of thy love display,
And favor that shall never cease.


2. We seek the truth which Jesus brought;
His path of light we long to tread;
Here be his holy doctrines taught,
And here their purest influence shed.


3. May faith, and hope, and love, abound:
Our sins and errors be forgiven:
And we, from day to day, be found
Children of God and heirs of Heaven.
